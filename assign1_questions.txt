Notes:
------
-do we need to account for a completely empty file?
-for makefile, test still recompiles. need to fix?
-note that if an issue is fixed, that doesn't include whitespace. still
	need to fix whitespace
-make sure that NO whitespace is printed after bst in matilda or bst.c [x]
-just need to double check anywhere -opts are printed to make sure there's
	no trailing whitespace

Questions to ask Lusth:
-------------------------
-for #26-30, I have the exact same postfix but my output number is like 
	decimals off. Do you have any idea why?
Tests failed ([x] - fixed):
---------------------------
#14 - makefile issue. recompiling when it shouldn't be "make; make"[x]
#18 - problem w/ negatives. fixed (minus whitespace?) yourcode-0-2 [x]
#19 - whitespace??? yourcode-0-3 [x]
#20 - problem w/ negatives. fixed (minus whitespace?) yourcode-0-4 [x]
#21 - problem w/ negatives. fixed (minus whitespace?) yourcode-0-5 [x]
#22 - whitespace??? yourcode-0-6 [x - whitespace fix should fix]
#23 - whitespace??? yourcode-0-7 [x - same as above]
#25 - problem w/ negatives. fixed (minus whitespace?) yourcode-0-9 [x]
#26->30 - segfault. check to see if fixing negatives fixed this. [x]
